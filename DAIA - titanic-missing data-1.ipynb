It could be a requirement of the  machine learning model that it needs a complete set of values for a feature. There are several options as you know. Deleting rows can reduce missing values, but it also reduces the total amount of data... Another way is to fill  it in with guesses. You will be introducing some noise into a model, but if you canmake reasonable guesses, some of them should be close to the historical truth (whatever it was...), and the overall predictive power of the model might still make a better model than before.
